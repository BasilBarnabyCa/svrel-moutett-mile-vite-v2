							Mr. Mouttet shared: “Racing fans across the Caribbean have been longing for the return of
							racing on a grand scale, and with that in mind, we are proud to have created the Mouttet
							Mile Invitational. The event will serve as the post pandemic renaissance of prestigious
							horseracing at the iconic Caymanas Park. As ardent lovers of horse racing and believers in
							the vision of Caymanas Park, our family has worked closely with the SVREL team to put
							together what is bound to become an eagerly anticipated signature event, attracting a high
							number of entries as well as one that generates significant revenue and a highly enjoyable
							day of racing for all the industry stakeholders”
						</p>
						<p class="text-gray-700">
							In just two (2) years, the event has achieved considerable success in garnering increased
							support from corporate Jamaica, a growing number of overseas entrants and jockeys, and the
							pivotal partnership, in 2023, with the New York Racing Association (NYRA) to broadcast the
							Mouttet Mile live on FOX Sports. A major part of the Mouttet Mile experience is the theme of
							the event. This year our theme is “Wild West Wear”, and we are inviting our punters to get
							into the fun of the country and western theme and don their best interpretation of the wild,
							wild west.

							Allowance group for a purse of US$25,000. A third co-main feature - The Bruceontheloose
							Sprint – was added in the 2023 staging of the event. Widely acknowledged as one of the
							finest racers at Park, Bruceontheloose, without doubt, has pencilled his name not only in
							the record books, but in the hearts and minds of many race goers. The Bruceontheloose Sprint
							Trophy is a captivating Grade Two event at 6 ½ furlongs, which will add another dimension of
							pulsating action to the already storied and rich Mouttet Mile race day. The race carries a
							lucrative total purse of J$2.5 million.
